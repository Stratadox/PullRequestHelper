;)

You *know* your code works. 
You *know* it's flawless.

Deep down, your colleagues know it too.

And still, they insist on tests.

Pesky, annoying unit tests, boring feature tests...
Even *integration tests* - as if that word even means anything.

Everyone knows it's completely useless. Won't even make production!

But for some strange reason they insist on a green bar.
And bloody "code coverage" - where do they even find all those words?

Obviously, you'd rather tell them your mind.
But you also want your code merged into master.

Here's a tool to help you out!

Extend *this* TestCase and your tests will fail no longer!
If you can't extend, just use the trait to make each `AssertEquals` pass.

If you were having trouble with failing tests - they will fail no more.

Are the bugs solved? No, of course not. But the tests pass! So there!
